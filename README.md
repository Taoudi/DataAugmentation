# DataAugmentation
Battling the unblananced dataset problem using different data augmentation methods

The network models in the project use the area under the ROC curve (AUC)[1] as a metric for assessing prediction performance. This is because overall accuracy is not a suitable metric as it does not take class imbalance into account. 

- [X] Oversampling through standard duplication
- [ ] Oversampling through duplication with small noise
- [ ] Oversampling using SMOTE 
- [ ] Oversampling using mixup
